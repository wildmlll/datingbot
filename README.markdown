# DateBot üíå

A fun and interactive Telegram bot built with **Python** and **aiogram**, designed to help users create and share dating profiles, connect with others, and find matches based on their preferences. Powered by a SQLite database, this bot offers a simple yet engaging way to meet new people in a Telegram environment.

This pet project was created to showcase my skills in Python development and Telegram bot creation.

## ‚ú® Features

- **User Profiles**: Create a dating profile with details like name, age, city, gender, and a photo, along with a short bio.
- **Matchmaking**: Browse random profiles based on your preferences (gender, age, city) and react with "Like" or "Skip."
- **Ephemeral Interaction**: Like a profile to notify the other user and share your Telegram handle for direct communication.
- **Profile Management**: Edit your profile text, update your photo, or delete your profile entirely.
- **Channel Subscription Check**: Ensures users are subscribed to a specific Telegram channel for access to the bot's features.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python, aiogram (Telegram Bot API framework)
- **Database**: SQLite for storing user profiles and preferences
- **Storage**: Local file storage for user-uploaded photos
- **Deployment**: Python script running with a Telegram bot token

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run DateBot locally.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Telegram Bot Token (obtained from [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather))
- SQLite database setup
- pip for installing dependencies

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wildmlll/datingbot
   cd datingbot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install aiogram
   ```

3. **Set up the Telegram Bot**:
   - Create a bot via [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and obtain the API token.
   - Update the bot token in `bot.py`:
     ```python
     bot = Bot(token="BOTAPI")
     ```

4. **Set up the SQLite database**:
   - Ensure a SQLite database file (`database.db`) is created in the project directory.
   - The bot uses a `BotDB` class (assumed to be defined in `db.py`) to manage user data and profiles. Ensure the database schema includes tables for users and profiles with fields for `user_id`, `gender`, `interest`, `name`, `age`, `city`, and `text`.

5. **Create a photos directory**:
   - Create a `photos` folder in the project directory to store user-uploaded images:
     ```bash
     mkdir photos
     ```

6. **Run the bot**:
   ```bash
   python bot.py
   ```

### Database Setup

- Ensure the `BotDB` class in `db.py` handles:
  - User registration (`add_user`, `user_exists`)
  - Profile creation and management (`add_anketa`, `get_anketa`, `update_text`, `delete_anketa`)
  - Profile matching (`find_anketi` based on user preferences)
- Set up the SQLite database with the necessary tables and indexes for efficient querying.

### Telegram Channel Setup

- Create a Telegram channel for subscription checks (e.g., `https://t.me/testkurilka1`).
- Update the `chat_id` in the bot‚Äôs subscription check logic:
  ```python
  member = await bot.get_chat_member(chat_id=-1002019990616, user_id=message.from_user.id)
  ```
  Replace `-1002019990616` with your channel‚Äôs chat ID.

## üì± Running the Bot

- Start the bot with `python bot.py`.
- Open Telegram and interact with your bot using the `/start` command.
- Follow the prompts to create a profile, browse other profiles, or manage your existing profile.
